# Reference Files

This folder contains the original HTML and CSS files that were used as the source for creating the React watercolor components.

## Files

- `watercolor.html` - Original HTML demo from Simey's CodePen
- `watercolor.css` - Original CSS styles with watercolor effects
- `WatercolorDividerGreen.tsx` - This generated svg is super weird and cool so I thought I would save it.


## Purpose

These files are preserved for:
- **Reference** - Understanding the original implementation
- **Documentation** - Showing the evolution from HTML/CSS to React components  
- **Learning** - Comparing the original techniques with the React adaptation
